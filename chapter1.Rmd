#### What I feel about this course
This course seems really challenging! The course title is "Introduction to Open Data Science", and the first exercise is already freaking me out...
Oh and hello to the person who will be reviewing this, my name is Tzu-lin Su, you can just call me Lin. I'm an exchange student from Sydney~ yay!!!
